# Custom `printf` Implementation in C

This project is a complete custom implementation of the C standard library function `printf`. It was built from scratch to emulate the functionality of `printf`, including handling formatted output, variable arguments, and custom specifiers.

By developing this project, I demonstrated my ability to work with core C concepts such as variadic functions, buffer management, and memory handling while ensuring efficient and precise output formatting. This implementation is designed to be lightweight, modular, and maintainable, showcasing my understanding of low-level programming.

## Key Features

* **Custom Formatting**: Supports a variety of format specifiers including `%d`, `%c`, `%s`, `%x`, and more.
* **Variable Argument Handling**: Implements variadic functions using `stdarg.h`.
* **Efficient Buffer Management**: Reduces system calls by buffering output for improved performance.
* **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms to handle invalid format specifiers and edge cases gracefully.
* **Portability**: Designed to be compatible with different environments and compilers.

## Purpose

This project serves as an in-depth exploration of how foundational functions like `printf` operate under the hood. By recreating such a ubiquitous function, I deepened my understanding of:

* The inner workings of the C standard library.
* Advanced usage of pointers and memory manipulation.
* Implementing modular and reusable code in C.
